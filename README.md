udacity ajax project

This is the readme for the UDACITY Neighborhood Map Project. The project is meant to be an exercise in making AJAX requests and handling the data that is returned.

In order to try this page, download the files as a zip and then unzip the files into your comp;uter. If you do not have software for unzipping files I highly recommend Zipeg at http://www.zipeg.com/. Once You have done this, open up the folder where you unzipped your files and click on index.html. If the index.html file does not automatically open in your web browser, you can right click on index.html then go to "Open with", then choose your web browser of choice.

Once index.html is open in your web browser, simply enter an address, city and state to begin. Then, you can click submit and information from Wikipedia and the New York Times will appear. In addition, the background image will change to a snapshot of the vicinity of the address you entered.
